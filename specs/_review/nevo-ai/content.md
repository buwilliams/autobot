## About Page

# About Nevo.ai

## Our Story

Nevo began as a technology consultancy focused on helping organizations navigate digital transformation. As artificial intelligence evolved from theoretical possibility to practical business tool, we recognized its unprecedented potential to reshape every aspect of how organizations operate and compete.

In 2017, under Pete Jaffe's leadership, we pivoted to focus exclusively on helping forward-thinking organizations harness AI's transformative power.

Our approach combines deep technical expertise with practical business experience, allowing us to bridge the gap between AI's possibilities and tangible business outcomes. We believe that AI's greatest value lies not in incremental improvement but in fundamental transformation—creating new possibilities that previously didn't exist.

## Our Philosophy

At Nevo.ai, we believe that:

**AI is fundamentally transformative, not merely additive.** The organizations that thrive will be those that reimagine their businesses around AI's capabilities, not those that simply layer it onto existing processes.

**Human-AI partnership creates the greatest value.** The most powerful implementations combine AI's analytical capabilities with human creativity, judgment, and emotional intelligence.

**Strategic implementation matters more than technical sophistication.** The competitive advantage comes not from having the most advanced AI, but from applying it most effectively to your specific business challenges and opportunities.

**Organizational readiness determines success.** Technology is only one component of successful AI transformation—culture, skills, processes, and leadership are equally crucial.

**Ethical considerations must be integrated from the start.** Responsible AI implementation that considers societal impact and aligns with organizational values creates sustainable competitive advantage.

## Our Approach

We work as true partners with our clients, taking the time to understand not just their technical environments but their organizational culture, competitive landscape, and strategic objectives.

Rather than applying a one-size-fits-all methodology, we craft customized approaches for each engagement, recognizing that AI transformation is uniquely shaped by an organization's specific context and goals.

Our multidisciplinary team brings perspectives from technology, business strategy, organizational psychology, and design thinking to create holistic solutions that address all dimensions of successful transformation.
