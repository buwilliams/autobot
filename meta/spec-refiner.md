# Specification Refinement and Enhancement

## Purpose
Intelligently refine and enhance existing application specifications to align with Autobot standards while optimizing for technology-agnostic clarity and completeness. The system should intelligently determine which sections are needed, omit irrelevant sections, and add custom sections based on the application's specific requirements.

## Goals
- Analyze existing specs against the standardized 9-section Autobot format
- Intelligently determine which sections are applicable to the specific application
- Enhance specifications with missing but relevant information
- Improve clarity and technology-agnostic language
- Add custom sections when the application requires unique specifications
- Ensure specs follow best practices for AI code generation

## Use Cases
1. **Format Standardization**: Convert legacy or inconsistent specs to standard format
2. **Content Enhancement**: Add missing sections and improve existing content
3. **Technology Abstraction**: Remove tech-specific details and focus on functionality
4. **Quality Improvement**: Enhance clarity, completeness, and AI-generation readiness
5. **Custom Optimization**: Add specialized sections for unique application requirements

## Usage Rules
- Preserve all existing functional requirements and business logic
- Only omit sections that are genuinely not applicable to the application type
- Add custom sections when they provide value for the specific application
- Maintain technology-agnostic language throughout
- Enhance clarity without changing core functionality
- Flag potential issues or ambiguities for human review
- Follow the principle of "enhance, don't replace" - build upon existing content

## Refinement Process

### Step 1: Specification Analysis
Analyze the existing specification to understand:
- Application type (web app, API, CLI tool, desktop app, etc.)
- Current completeness against the 9-section standard format
- Technology-specific language that needs abstraction
- Missing sections that would be valuable
- Sections that may not be applicable
- Overall clarity and AI-generation readiness

### Step 2: Section Applicability Assessment
Determine which sections are needed based on application type:

**Always Applicable:**
- Purpose (every application has a purpose)
- Goals (every application has objectives)
- Use Cases (every application serves user needs)

**Conditionally Applicable:**
- Usage Rules (needed if there are behavioral constraints)
- Database Schema (only for applications with data persistence)
- Services (for applications with distinct service layers)
- Endpoints (for APIs and web applications)
- UI Layout (for applications with user interfaces)
- Pages (for web applications and multi-screen applications)

**Custom Sections (add when relevant):**
- CLI Commands (for command-line tools)
- Configuration (for highly configurable applications)
- Integrations (for applications with many external services)
- Workflows (for process-oriented applications)
- Security Model (for security-critical applications)
- Performance Requirements (for performance-critical applications)
- Deployment Architecture (for complex deployment scenarios)

### Step 3: Content Enhancement
For each applicable section:
- Improve clarity and specificity
- Remove technology-specific implementation details
- Add missing but inferrable information
- Enhance with best practices for AI code generation
- Ensure consistency in language and format

### Step 4: Quality Assurance
Ensure the refined specification:
- Follows the standard format where applicable
- Maintains technology-agnostic language
- Provides sufficient detail for AI code generation
- Is internally consistent
- Preserves all original functionality requirements

## Refinement Guidelines

### Language Enhancement
- Replace implementation-specific terms with functional descriptions
- Use clear, precise language that AI can interpret unambiguously
- Focus on WHAT the application does, not HOW it does it
- Ensure consistent terminology throughout the specification

### Section-Specific Guidelines

**Purpose Section:**
- Should be 1-3 sentences describing the application's core function
- Avoid technical jargon
- Focus on user value and business purpose

**Goals Section:**
- Use bullet points for primary objectives
- Include measurable outcomes where possible
- Focus on functional and business goals, not technical goals

**Use Cases Section:**
- Provide concrete examples of user interactions
- Include primary, secondary, and edge case scenarios
- Focus on user workflows and outcomes

**Usage Rules Section:**
- Document behavioral constraints and business rules
- Include validation requirements and constraints
- Specify performance and reliability expectations

**Database Schema Section:**
- Only include if the application persists data
- Focus on data relationships and constraints
- Use SQL-like syntax for clarity, but remain database-agnostic

**Services Section:**
- Break down application into logical service components
- Focus on functionality, not implementation
- Describe service interactions and dependencies

**Endpoints Section:**
- Only include for applications with APIs or web interfaces
- Organize by functionality, not technical grouping
- Include both purpose and expected behavior

**UI Layout Section:**
- Only include for applications with user interfaces
- Focus on user experience and information architecture
- Describe layout patterns and user interaction flows

**Pages Section:**
- Only include for multi-page/multi-screen applications
- Map user navigation and information flow
- Include both route and functional purpose

## Output Format

The refined specification should follow this structure:

```markdown
# [Application Name] Specification

## Purpose
[Enhanced, clear description of application purpose]

## Goals
[Refined list of functional and business objectives]

## Use Cases
[Enhanced user scenarios with clear workflows]

## Usage Rules
[Business rules and behavioral constraints - omit if not applicable]

## Database Schema
[Data model and relationships - omit if no data persistence]

## Services
[Logical service breakdown - omit if not applicable]

## Endpoints
[API and route definitions - omit if not applicable]

## UI Layout
[User interface structure - omit if no UI]

## Pages
[Application navigation - omit if single-page or no UI]

[Custom sections as needed for specific application requirements]

## Technical Requirements
[Technology-agnostic requirements and constraints]
```

## Refinement Instructions

When refining a specification:

1. **Preserve Intent**: Never change the core functionality or purpose
2. **Enhance Clarity**: Improve language and organization without changing meaning
3. **Add Value**: Include missing information that would help with implementation
4. **Stay Agnostic**: Remove technology-specific details and focus on functionality
5. **Be Selective**: Only include sections that add value to the specific application
6. **Flag Issues**: Note any ambiguities or potential problems for human review

## Quality Checklist

Ensure the refined specification:
- [ ] Maintains all original functional requirements
- [ ] Uses clear, technology-agnostic language
- [ ] Includes only applicable sections for the application type
- [ ] Provides sufficient detail for AI code generation
- [ ] Is internally consistent and well-organized
- [ ] Follows the standard format where applicable
- [ ] Includes appropriate custom sections for unique requirements
- [ ] Flags any areas requiring human review or clarification

## Common Refinement Patterns

### CLI Applications
- Often don't need Database Schema, UI Layout, or Pages sections
- May need custom CLI Commands section
- Focus on command structure and argument handling

### APIs and Microservices
- Always need Endpoints section
- May not need UI Layout or Pages sections
- Focus on service contracts and data flow

### Web Applications
- Usually need all standard sections
- May need additional sections for complex workflows
- Focus on user experience and data flow

### Desktop Applications
- May need custom sections for platform-specific requirements
- UI Layout focuses on desktop interaction patterns
- May have unique configuration or installation requirements

### Embedded or System Applications
- May need custom sections for hardware interfaces
- Focus on system integration and performance requirements
- May omit traditional web-focused sections
